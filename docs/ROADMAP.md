# Roadmap register

_As of 37d7a4f2._

Committed and sequenced work — open (`planned`) items only. Shipped work is
documented per subsystem in [`system-capabilities/`](system-capabilities/README.md)
(the slice-by-slice history lives in git). Deferred ideas live in
[`FUTURE.md`](FUTURE.md); known defects in [`ISSUES.md`](ISSUES.md). Grammar:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-docs-registers-consolidation-design.md`.

## catalog

- [ ] **Catalog views — dataset/type decoupling** `{#road-catalog-views area:catalog status:planned from:operator-brainstorm pr:- spec:2026-07-13-catalog-views-design}`
  A **view** as a first-class virtual dataset: base table + optional `RowFilter` predicate + optional column projection, sharing the `(schema, name)` namespace with physical tables so `ObjectType.table` binds it and `PolicyTarget::Table` grants it unchanged — subsets of one physical dataset get independent permission scopes without row duplication (today's workaround is dataset-partition-per-scope, `grimoire-kg-agenda`). Engine-side expansion at serving resolution; write-through (insert/PATCH/delete gated by the view predicate — a written row must stay visible in the writer's view); `/datasets` + lineage treat views as dataset nodes; base-drop protection. Deferred residues at landing: view nesting, subscribe-on-view, arbitrary-SQL views, pushdown stats. Relates to (does not close) [[fut-fgac-subject-attribute]].

## acl

- [ ] **Comprehensive auth capability — build-vs-adopt a fuller identity layer** `{#road-auth-comprehensive area:acl status:planned from:2026-06-23-auth-password-session-design pr:- spec:2026-07-01-auth-comprehensive-adopt-design}`
  The committed decision to grow loom's hand-rolled `#road-auth-password-session` foundation into a **fuller identity layer**, taken as one unit rather than a scatter of independent slices. The spec's **first job is the build-vs-adopt fork**: continue extending loom's own `auth` concern, or integrate an established auth library/service — evaluated against loom's constraints (hermetic buck2 build, no external mail infra today, `SubjectId`-centric ACL model, self-hosted deploy). Whichever path wins, its **acceptance surface** is the deferred identity follow-ons this subsumes: TOTP/OTP second factor [[fut-auth-totp-mfa]], passkeys/WebAuthn [[fut-auth-passkeys]], SAML federation [[fut-auth-saml]], per-IP login rate-limiting [[fut-auth-login-rate-limit]], password policy (forced rotation + strength) [[fut-auth-password-policy]], and session refresh / sliding expiry [[fut-auth-session-refresh]] — those `fut-auth-*` ideas stay in FUTURE as the detailed surface this item delivers against. **Out (stay deferred, not part of this item):** email reset ([[fut-auth-email-reset]], hard-blocked on mail infra), service-token scoping ([[fut-auth-token-scoping]]) and the first-class auth-admin capability ([[fut-auth-admin-capability]]) (both gate on a real least-privilege / multi-operator need), and the `Debug`-redaction hygiene fix ([[fut-auth-credential-debug-redact]]). Depends on `#road-auth-password-lifecycle` landing first. Spec to follow — expect it to decompose into slices once the build-vs-adopt call is made.
