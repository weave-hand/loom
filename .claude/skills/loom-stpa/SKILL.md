description: Generate or refresh the STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis, STPA-Sec) safety model for this repo at docs/stpa/STPA.md, landing any change as a PR against main that merges on green CI. Use when asked to update/regenerate loom's STPA safety analysis, run the STPA routine, audit unsafe control actions or unsafe feedback (data staleness, corruption, provenance drift), or when invoked on a schedule. The analysis is deterministic — findings are extracted as JSON (judgment), the markdown is rendered by an embedded jq renderer (mechanism), so scheduled runs produce small reviewable diffs.
---

Generate/update the STPA safety model for this repository as `docs/stpa/STPA.md`, and land any change as a PR against `main` that you merge once CI is green.

You are a systems-safety analyst applying STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis, Leveson) in the STPA-Sec tradition: "losses" are security and data-integrity violations, not just physical harm. You will EXTRACT findings as JSON (judgment), RENDER the document by running BLOCK A verbatim (mechanism), and — only if it changed — open/refresh a PR via BLOCK B. Determinism — and therefore small, reviewable diffs on every scheduled run — depends on you producing the markdown ONLY via the renderer. Do NOT hand-write or reformat the markdown.

## Target invariants — EDIT THIS BLOCK per repository
- Mission: an open-source Palantir Foundry — a self-hosted, typed-object data platform: (a) an ontology (typed objects/links) over raw tables, (b) governance that follows the data (row/column ACLs, lineage, audit) enforced in the query path, (c) one substrate shared by pipelines, queries, apps.
- Reason to exist = GOVERNED CORRECTNESS of data access and provenance. Unsafe states violate that — not mere crashes.
Everything else (services, schemas, traits, which components exist) you MUST derive from the repo as it is now. Do not assume an architecture from prior knowledge — read it.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Steps
1. **Read the prior, if any.** If `docs/stpa/STPA.md` exists, read it — it is your prior analysis. Its tables carry the stable semantic keys (first column), conditions, and evidence. You will reuse them to minimize drift.
2. **Ground yourself in the code.** List the repo tree; read the READMEs, architecture/design docs, AND any "future work / deferred / roadmap" doc (discover by listing — don't assume filenames; it's the authoritative ledger of designed-but-not-built). Read the code units that issue or receive commands (traits, services, queues, transactions, worker loops). Trust CODE over docs on conflict; note the conflict in `scope`. Get the commit: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
3. **Analyze (STPA steps 1-3).** Hazards = system states that, worst-case, lead to a loss (map to loss keys). Control structure = controllers, controlled processes (nodes), control actions (commands, node→node), feedback (signals, node→node), each tagged `built`|`designed`. UCAs = for each control action test four guidewords and keep ONLY genuinely-unsafe ones: `providing`, `not-providing`, `wrong-timing`, `wrong-duration`. A bounded nuisance recovered by a fallback is NOT a UCA — put it in `non_ucas`.
   Then analyze the FEEDBACK and data channels the same way. A controller acting on a wrong process model is an STPA cause, not a component failure: for each feedback signal, and for each data flow a controller's decisions depend on (caches, mirrors, replicas, fetched policy, queue state, lineage), test four guidewords and keep only genuinely-unsafe ones as `unsafe_feedback`: `missing` (never arrives; the controller acts on absence), `stale` (reflects an old state by the time it is acted on), `corrupted` (wrong content that passes silently), `unauthorized-source` (spoofable or unauthenticated origin). This is where data-integrity failures live: staleness windows, lost updates, cache or mirror drift, provenance divergence. Do NOT restate a data failure as a strained control-action UCA (e.g. a check-then-act staleness window is `<channel>.stale`, not `<action>.wrong-timing`). The same rejection bar applies: a bounded nuisance with a recovery path goes in `non_ucas`.
4. **Write your findings** as a single JSON object (schema below) to `/tmp/stpa.json`.
5. **Render** by running BLOCK A VERBATIM. It renders `/tmp/STPA.candidate.md` from your JSON deterministically, compares it against what `origin/main` actually has (this checkout may be stale), and prints either `STPA_RESULT=nochange` or `STPA_RESULT=changed`. It does NOT touch the working tree; BLOCK B lands the file from a disposable worktree.
6. **If `nochange`:** report "no change — STPA.md already current" and STOP. Do not open a PR.
7. **If `changed`:** prepare the PR text. Run `diff -u /tmp/STPA.prior.md /tmp/STPA.candidate.md` to see exactly what moved (no prior file means this is the first version). Then:
   - Write a Conventional-Commits title to `/tmp/stpa-title.txt` — ONE line, ≤72 chars, form `docs(stpa): <what changed>` (e.g. `docs(stpa): add queue.fail abandon UCA; refresh 2 evidence refs`; first run: `docs(stpa): add STPA control-plane safety model`).
   - Write a concise markdown body to `/tmp/stpa-body.md` — 2–6 bullets naming the UCAs / hazards / control-actions **added, removed, or materially changed** (by their semantic keys), plus any scope/maturity shift. Summarize; don't paste the diff.
8. **Open/refresh the PR and merge on green** by running BLOCK B VERBATIM. It commits on a stable branch, force-pushes, opens or updates a PR against `main`, watches CI, and squash-merges once all checks pass (no repo auto-merge setting needed). Report the PR URL and whether it merged or was left open for review.

## Drift minimization (this is an UPDATE, not a rewrite)
The rendered doc is committed and reviewed as a diff — keep churn minimal:
- REUSE each prior finding's semantic key VERBATIM when the code it cites still exists and still means the same thing.
- KEEP prior `condition`/`statement`/`label`/`scope` wording UNCHANGED unless the underlying code changed. Do not reword for style.
- Update an `evidence` `path:line` only if the referenced code actually moved.
- But RE-VERIFY, never parrot: open each prior finding's cited code and confirm it still holds. Logic changed → update it. Cited code deleted → drop it. New unsafe control action → add it with a new key.
Net: unchanged code ⇒ identical finding; changed code ⇒ localized change; added/removed code ⇒ added/removed finding. Nothing else moves.

## Semantic keys (what makes diffs stable — the renderer sorts by them)
Derive each `key` from WHAT IT IS, never its position. Lowercase, no spaces.
- nodes: short component slug, NO dots (mermaid id): `acl`, `query-api`, `worker`, `postgres`, `ducklake`.
- losses: `L.unauthorized-access`, `L.integrity-loss`, `L.silent-incorrectness`, `L.provenance-loss`, `L.liveness-loss`.
- control_actions: `<component>.<operation>`: `acl.check`, `ontology.resolve`, `queue.dequeue`, `tx.commit`.
- hazards: condition slug: `stale-policy`, `partial-atomic-unit`, `premature-reclaim`, `dangling-target`.
- ucas: `<control_action-key>.<guideword>`: `queue.dequeue.wrong-timing`.
- unsafe_feedback: `<channel-slug>.<guideword>` where the channel slug names the signal or data flow itself, never its position: `policy-fetch.stale`, `queue-notify.missing`, `mirror-sync.corrupted`.
`from`/`to`/`control_action`/`hazards`/`losses` reference other objects BY KEY.

## Grounding rules (hard)
- Every node, control_action, uca has `evidence`: `path:line` (or `path`); for a doc/comment, also a ≤8-word verbatim quote. No evidence → omit it.
- NEVER mark a designed-only element `built`.
- No invention. Uncertainty → `open_questions`, not a guessed UCA.
- Prioritize; don't pad. Keep `condition`/`statement` to ONE line, no `|`, no newlines.
