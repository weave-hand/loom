//! loom-native, DataFusion-backed serving engine for file-backed Iceberg tables.
//! Reads the `iceberg_mirror` projection (via `IcebergCatalog`), registers each
//! live table's Parquet files (absolute `file://` paths) as a DataFusion table,
//! and runs the governed/compiled SQL through DataFusion — no DuckDB in the path.
//! See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-iceberg-datafusion-serving-engine-design.md.
